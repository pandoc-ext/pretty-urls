pretty-urls
==================================================================

[![GitHub build status][CI badge]][CI workflow]

This filter "prettifies" bare URLs by removing the protocol
prefix, i.e., it drops the `https://` from the link text while
leaving the actual link unchanged.

Example: the URL `<https://pandoc.org>` is rewritten as if it was
defined as `[pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org)`.

- **Before**: <https://pandoc.org>
- **After**: [pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org)

URLs for which the description is different from the target are
left unchanged.
